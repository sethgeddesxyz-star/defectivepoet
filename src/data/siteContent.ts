export const bio = `Christian Zachary Geddes was born December 3rd 1974 and died December 21st 2004. At nineteen he became a father and his baby boy would soon become one of the most important things in his life. By his early twenties he was working hard day-in and day-out to make ends meet. Like many who feel the burden of life heavy upon them, Zach found solace in what simple and destructive pleasures a man has at his means. He was a poet, a musician, a dreamer and a junkie. The depth of humanity in all its wretched beauty was the flame that drew Zach like a moth. At the age of 27, he blew out his knee snowboarding and was prescribed opiates, marking the beginning of the end. A few years would pass where the gates of creativity were knocked off their hinges, and he poured forth a deluge of bittersweet musings on paper napkins and coffee-stained notebooks. In late night recording sessions he'd strum a three-stringed rusty guitar, bang on trash can drumsets, and wail his heart into a 1950's bullet mic. His music is raw, bleeding raw and muddy and brimming with more humanity than most music one finds today, it comes across as some kind of mix between Tom Waits, early Beck, Bob Log III, tossed with Ernest Hemingway and the beat poets.`;

export const bioSecondParagraph = `Zach was deeply troubled by the moral sickness of a world that was moving too fast, too hard and too soulless. He took joy in simplicity, was never unkind, very pleasant to be around, and often very humorous and witty, but deep inside Zach lived the tormented poet. In a tattered notebook, one will read the line "the only good poet is a dead one." Zach was a defective poet, and it is exactly this defect that was the source of his pain and the source of the heartrending beauty that his pain chased him towards. This was Zach, and like many shooting stars who burn bright and furiously, his light went out... and in the wake, we find a collection of poems and musical recordings.`;

export const aboutThisSite = `This site represents the life work of my departed brother Zach Geddes. His recordings can tell no story as just files on my hard drive, so here they are for all the world to hear. His poems can touch no hearts buried in my closet, so here they are for all the world to read, in their original form with spelling mistakes and all. It is my hope that sharing his life work may inspire you, and that the depth and rawness herein might touch something in you that lives deep within us all.`;

export const zachMusicQuote = `I hope you enjoy these songs. There are several different styles that Zach embodies, so take a moment to listen to a few different songs and you may find something you like. I curated the American Sinner album based on some of the recordings that stood out to me. A few of the songs below are highly produced and developed, where others were late night "ideas" jotted down and would have been picked up later if time permitted. All songs are produced and recorded by Zach Geddes, and he plays most of the instruments in these recordings. There are other musicians accompanying Zach in many of these songs as well, and I simply don't know who is playing what in which recordings so I apologize for not giving credit where it is due. It is truly an honor to share with the world my brother's life work.`;

export const poemsIntro = `The rough, raw, and mildly illegible presentation of these poems fits Zach's taste and I believe he would find this a fitting way to display them. Like the words written within the poems, like the observations Zach makes in his writings, the poem's presentation is also painfully true and hides nothing. Zach couldn't spell for shit and he knew it, he simply didn't give a damn about that. His skills and his interests were more suited to crafting words from his joys, his sorrows, and all that he observed around him. I've titled many of the poems/writings for this table of contents simply for ease of reference, most of Zach's work was untitled. He didn't care much for the surface of things, but what was inside it, what was behind it, and what comes through it.`;
